My name is Jesse Cravens. I live in Middle Tennessee with my wife and three boys. I love the raw beauty of Tennessee and can often be found enjoying a hike near a several of the area waterfalls, especially when it is not too hot. 

My other hobbies include Aikido and volunteering with the Civil Air Patrol as both a flight crew member and with our youth development program.
